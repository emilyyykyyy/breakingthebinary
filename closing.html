	<p> bucks school districts has long perpetuated the constant transphobia and homophobia occurring in bucks schools. through book bans, disregarding gender nonconforming students' identities, and prohibiting pride flags - schools have become an unsafe place for trans students. 
	<br><br>
	schools should be a welcoming place for everyone, but it couldn't be anything further than that. district administration and board have turned a blind eye to discrimination; moreover, they have actively sought out policies that target genderqueer individuals, furthering a harmful environment for learning. 
	<br> <br>
	trans students need safe spaces to learn. through hateful and discriminatory policies, bucks county schools have only furthered gender inequity and injustice.
